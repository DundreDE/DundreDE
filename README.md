# Hello there, I'm Native ðŸ‘‹

I'm a young coder who wrote my first lines of code in 2021, and I've been on a (sometimes chaotic) coding journey ever since!

## A little about me:
- **Name:** Native (but you already knew that ðŸ˜Ž)
- **Started coding:** 2021
- **Current skills:** 
  - **Tailwind CSS** (my favorite tool for styling!)
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript (trying not to break the web)
  - Python (the snake that doesn't bite... I hope)
  - Learning React Native next (yeah, that name suits me perfectly)
  - ðŸ˜‚ "lol" might describe my overall coding experience... but we're getting there!

## What you'll find here:
- Projects that sometimes work (but hey, it's all about learning)
- Code that may or may not be optimized
- A whole lot of enthusiasm and improvement over time ðŸš€

Feel free to check out my repositories, laugh at my bugs (or help me fix them), and watch me evolve from *"skills are lul"* to *"skills are cool"*!

Happy coding!
